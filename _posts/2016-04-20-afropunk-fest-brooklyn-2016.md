description: "So why is AFROPUNK giving \"POWER TO THE PARTY?\" Because we trust the friction, the transference of great capacity to the free spirit, belief in the high-heeled spark of the assembly, and the group-mind's ability to choose a glorious path. This isn't about getting elected, or being protected; it's about staking a claim."
