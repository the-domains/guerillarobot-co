Courtesy of German website Jedi-Bibliotek, which acquired pages from a tie-in book titled "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story: The Official Visual Story Guide," it appears that Darth Vader will indeed be appearing in the standalone film directed by Gareth Edwards. Plenty of other information is now available as well: In addition to two new spacecraft --- the Rebels' U-Wing and the Empire's TIE Striker --- we now have character names of the major players.

Ben Mendelssohn is playing an Imperial officer named Director Krennic; Diego Luna will be a Rebel officer named Captain Cassian Andor; Riz Ahmed is Bodhi, a fellow Rebel soldier; Jiang Wen plays Baze, a "freelance assassin;" Donnie Yen is Chirrut, a "spiritual warrior." In addition, the names Pao and Bistan have been assigned to two "fierce warriors" who also happen to be aliens, though it hasn't been confirmed who's playing them. Based on a recent interview, Mads Mikkelsen will be the father of Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), though his character hasn't been named yet; neither, for that matter, has Forest Whitaker's.
