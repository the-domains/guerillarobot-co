  Nine mothers whose black children were murdered by police took the stage at
  the Democratic National Convention last night to endorse Hillary Clinton for
  President of the United States. For me, seeing these mothers on the stage
  elicited joy, as black women are lifted up on behalf of their children killed
  by the state.
