  Visions of the future of medicine often involve digital sensors that
  constantly monitor patients, but not many people imagine that these sensors
  could be stitched directly into us. But that's the suggestion of a team of
  researchers from Tuft University, who have developed prototype " smart
  stitches" that can be used to close wounds - but also send real-time data on
  tissue health to doctors.
