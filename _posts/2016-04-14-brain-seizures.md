<article style=""><h1>IBM Wants to Implant Fake Brains in Real Brains to Prevent Seizures</h1><p>Talk about neural networking. In Melbourne, Australia, Stefan Harrer is running an artificial software brain atop an artificial hardware brain in an effort to analyze a brain that isn't artificial at all. Ultimately, he and his colleagues envision merging these three brains together so that the artificial can augment the real.</p><img src="http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GettyImages-535633613-feat-1200x630.jpg" /></article>
