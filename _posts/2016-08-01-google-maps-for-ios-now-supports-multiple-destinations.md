  Google Maps is adding a very useful feature to iOS today: the ability to add
  multiple stops to a single trip. Rather than only directing you from point A
  to point B, Maps can now bring you from point B to point C, D, E, and so on,
  making it much easier to plan a trip if you intend to bounce around and make
  occasional pitstops.
