  ARM Holdings, a chip design firm that doesn't manufacture or sell any chips,
  has just been bought by SoftBank for a cool $31.4 billion. That's four times
  as much as Microsoft paid for Nokia, close to three times Google's expenditure
  on Motorola, and an order of magnitude more than Palm cost HP.
