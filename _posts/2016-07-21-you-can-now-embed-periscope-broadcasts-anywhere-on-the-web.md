  Periscope broadcasts can now be embedded elsewhere on the web, including both
  ongoing live ones and already-recorded streams. The Twitter-owned service says
  starting today, all you need to do to use the feature is embed a tweet
  containing the Periscope stream and it will play just like a standard embedded
  GIF or video file.
