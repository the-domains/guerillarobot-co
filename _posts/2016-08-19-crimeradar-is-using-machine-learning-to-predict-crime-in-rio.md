  It may sound like something from the Minority Report, but this app can predict
  where crimes will take place. The software, called CrimeRadar, has just
  launched its prototype in the Olympic host city of Rio de Janeiro. The app
  uses advanced machine learning to predict crime rates in the city's
  neighbourhoods at different times of the day and night.
