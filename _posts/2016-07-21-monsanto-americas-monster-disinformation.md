  Last month, the University of San Francisco made an alarming discovery, that
  93% of Americans tested had traces of a chemical called glyphosate in their
  urine. Last year, the World Health Organization deemed glyphosate a "possible
  carcinogen". Glyphosate is the main ingredient in biotech giant Monsanto's
  flagship product: Roundup, an herbicide sprayed all over almost every acre of
  food grown.
