  WASHINGTON - President Obama has signed into law a measure that will require
  instant nationwide "Blue Alerts" to warn about threats to police officers and
  help track down the suspects who carry them out. The Rafael Ramos and Wenjian
  Liu National Blue Alert Act of 2015 is named for the two New York Police
  Department officers killed in an ambush attack last December.
